# dmcapp

dmcapp is a Shiny app that can be used to see the closest DMC embroidery floss colours for a given colour. 

The heavy lifting is all done by [dmc](https://github.com/sharlagelfand/dmc) - dmcapp only contains the Shiny application, which is hosted [here](https://sharlagelfand.shinyapps.io/dmcapp/).

If you would like to run the app locally:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sharlagelfand/dmcapp")
dmcapp::run_app()
```
